a) The training began on the first day with a coordination meeting with the secretary of the Kediri city education office, though it must be admitted that the situation at the meeting was quite tense at first because there were a lot of task mandates that needed to be followed up by school supervisors, making the situation for supervisor training afterwards a challenge.

b) All school supervisors from kindergarten to middle school attended this training, so when reflecting on the first cycle of LIC, the elementary school supervisor dominated the discussion. Nonetheless, it is apparent that the kindergarten and junior high school supervisors were interested in the program's implementation. 

FACILITATORS
Linking to purpose: the facilitators provided a rationale for revisiting LIC 1 and reflecting on their role in TNMs, but there was limited or no checking for understanding. The facilitators could have summarised the points mentioned by the participants and laid down their roles to ensure clarity. 
Recognition: Consistent recognition was given to the participants by the facilitator, but it is important to build consensus among the participants to also pay attention to the answers given by their peers.
Probing: How do you think this team building activity relates to your role as supervisors?"" This approach helped to deepen understanding and stimulate discussion.

After reflecting on the previous day's activities, several adjustments were made on the second day, including the implementation of learning strategies involving school supervisors. Apart from the emphasis on providing material, the material on the second day provides a forum for participants to discuss, solve problems through the activities provided, and work in groups to learn collaborative and cooperative strategies. As a result, the use of active learning strategies has encouraged participants to be actively involved in the learning process.

The second day's learning adaptation was also based on the results of a brief coordination reflection following the first day's training, which was led by the District Champions. On the second day, the discussion and feedback obtained became a benchmark for training design.

Learning Environment:
The participants were asked to reflect on yesterday's STIR activities from the first cycle and the benefits they personally received, in addition to aligning their perceptions of the STIR program. Even though the training didn't begin right away, the learning environment was still quite favorable. As a result, during the meeting that day, there were a number of points that could be further developed. Even though they were fasting, having a variety of games in between activities rekindled the participants' enthusiasm. It was an interesting experience to learn what the principal's real concern was during the discussion after the principal made some sort of argument that sparked pros and cons among the education officers in Kediri City and other school principals. After the training, the district champion additionally facilitated the activities of reflection and discussion.

The coaching was carried out at the coachee's request to undertake some preliminary work before EL Institutes across several sub-districts. This coachee is a district champion in the Lumajang district, and he supports Mr. Kholil (as school supervisor coordinator), but he wants to learn how to conduct sessions at EL institutes.


Several points were collected as a result of the coaching being applied at the time:
a. Curiosity 
Pak Heri has a strong drive to learn. Mr. Heri took the initiative in advance regarding the agenda that would be carried out at the EL Institute and ensuring the distribution of content material by the facilitator during the coaching. Mr. Heri highlighted numerous key comments when introducing the presentation material, such as ""In this part of the slide after the video, I think I need to re-emphasize the difference between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset."" He said that such a narrative should be introduced in a region that recently joined the second LIC.

And this story came as a result of Mr. Heri's reflection yesterday when presenting the topic at the supervisor training; he thinks it will be simpler to understand if examples from the growth mindset and the fixed mindset are compared.
Not only that, but Pak Heri checked with me to see whether or not the instances he offered between the growth mindset and the fixed mindset were right.
Another example is Pak Heri, who used yesterday's LIC 1 presentation material on Growth Mindset to cement his grasp during coaching calls.

b. Explore how the facilitation process may run smoothly while remaining enjoyable.
Later, Pak Heri described an excellent technique for the facilitation process. Mr. Heri first offered more team building, but I wondered if there was enough time available for this kind of activity. Pak Heri broke down the agenda and matched the timetable with each training aim, and Pak Heri finally determined that it appeared unachievable due to a shortage of time, and Pak Heri took the initiative to lead the ice-breaking at the very beginning. 

c. Initiative 
Pak Heri took the initiative to prepare himself by inviting me to discuss the EL Institute preparations. Furthermore, Mr. Heri attempted to redefine and present an overview of the issues faced in numerous sub-districts that had recently joined the second LIC, as well as outline what methods we may apply to anticipate future challenges.


Highlight of the session: 
However, there are some interesting things that Mr. Heri attempted to convey in this coaching session, such as some information related to the STIR program that he rarely receives, such as technical matters. As a result, Pak Heri must take the initiative to bring these concerns to the attention of the supervising coordinator, which is a tactical method that Pak Heri has been employing recently. He also assumed that this two-way communication was impossible due to time constraints and other factors.",45,Putra,NULL,combined,NULL,NULL,lumajang,Heri Purwanto,NULL,NULL,NULL,stir_dl,115c8110-bef7-4bf3-b4b5-69e473bd9059,2025-12-07 20:31:34+00,"{""changes"": []}"

There were various perspectives and responses conveyed by the participants. This happened at the beginning of the session because the initial agreement conveyed by the facilitator about accepting differences and normalizing errors needed to be part of the training earlier, so quite a number of participants gave their opinions when given the questions. Even in some conditions, participants took the initiative to express their opinions regarding the dimensions of U theory and in-depth discussions on the child's attention span section so that activating and calming strategies needed to be applied.

Even though it needs to be acknowledged that appreciation for participants when expressing opinions almost never happened, interestingly, the participants were still enthusiastic enough to express their opinions.

The activeness of the participants was evident not only from the thought-provoking questions given by the facilitator or on the presentation slides, but when given a comparison picture to define the meaning of collaboration, it was seen that many participants expressed opinions, and even there were differences of opinion from the pictures given. This may indicate that a visual learning style is also characteristic of participants in this area.

Overall, the participants showed engagement during the training and were enthusiastic in learning.

They had not previously participated in the first LIC, therefore there was some discussion regarding the STIR and LIC programs at the start of the training.

The participants were first perplexed about the importance of the training being provided by STIR, thus there were several questions at the start of the session to provide an explanation of the aims and objectives. It was noted during the discussion that just a few people had questions about the STIR program itself. Despite the fact that the facilitator's replies were not followed up by any inquiries from the participants.  

The participants only listened to the objectives of the STIR program itself. Trigger questions were indeed given by the facilitator relating to the duties and responsibilities of a school principal, but quite a few responded.

As the training progressed, the enthusiasm began to emerge from the participants when the facilitator asked questions related to the paradigm in school leadership. The participants were quite interested in this part, as seen from some of the responses given by the participants. The facilitator also always gives appreciation for every response given. In the middle of the activity the participants started to dare to express their opinions because the facilitator provided positive reinforcement like the theme in LIC 1 about growth mindset. Even though not all of them expressed their opinions and they were always the same person in giving their opinions, the participants almost always liked to overwrite their partners' answers or provide jokes in several conditions from the answers given by their partners.

When entering the U theory explanation and there was a display of image visualization and asked to interpret the image, unexpectedly there were unethical jokes made in the training forum by several participants. And the jokes were even responded by almost all participants in the training. Even though the facilitator tried to explain very well, the visualization of the picture was still a joke which in the end asked STIR, who was present at the time, to explain the meaning of the picture.

Because they had just joined, at the beginning of the session, the facilitator tried to explain what the STIR program was and what the role of the school principal was in imparting the material in this training to the teacher network meeting.

The activity began with a team building to make a tower, The participants were very enthusiastic about making a high tower, so several group members climbed on the table to try to make a very high tower. In this session, the cooperation of the group members was very visible, and the facilitator also tried to mingle and asked about the progress of the towers that each group had made. The atmosphere was even more lively when the facilitator took the initiative to play a song that was more uplifting for the participants.

After team building and group presentations, participants started learning material from this second LIC, In this session, the participants were quite involved in practicing collaborative and cooperative strategies, This was due to different learning methods, where the facilitator divided groups and asked them to read certain topics on divided guidebooks and perform simple games to understand the principles of collaborative, cooperative, and calming and activating strategies. The participants looked very active, following the agreed-upon game instructions. Followed by discussion activities, although it was seen that there were indeed some participants who had not listened when the other groups were presenting the results of their group's work. Even though it was acknowledged that there were some misconceptions about the topics presented, the facilitator tried to correct the wrong misconceptions by discussing them with other group members.

The training activity ended with the awarding of rewards from the school supervisor, There were rewards given to the best groups and the most active principals during the training session.

This makes students to prepare themselves before studying together in class.
The teacher is very good at checking students' understanding of learning by asking ""what did you learn last meeting?"" This helps students to recall past learning and is a good introduction to starting today's learning.
Another interesting thing is the use of division boards: The concept of learning from concrete → abstract makes it easier for students to understand the material. For example, when the teacher uses a blackboard, students can easily contextualize the division concept, rather than just stating the division number. This method turned out to be very effective for attracting the attention of participants, helping students to use their sensory sources for learning (seeing, feeling and sounding, listening), this really accommodates the learning styles of students who are quite diverse in class. Well done!
The strength of the teacher's teaching method also lies in giving examples and inviting students to answer back. For example: The teacher gives an example of division first and is discussed in one class, followed by The teacher asking one of the students to answer the question. This method is quite effective for testing whether students understand or not, including providing opportunities for some students to increase their self-confidence.
The teacher also accommodates students who sit behind by asking whether the writing on the board is legible or not. The way the teacher gives role models to students also ensures that all students are involved and take part in learning in class.
Pair and group strategies are also very effective, this can be seen from the instructions given which are very clear and students are asked to work in pairs. A very positive learning environment is enough to trigger other students to discuss with friends in other groups. This is quite effective for increasing student engagement.
Providing opportunities for students to answer their work in front of the class is also very helpful for students to increase their self-confidence, discussing together with one class, ensuring that all students also provide input if there is a student's work that is not quite right.",pesantren,NULL,NULL,kota_kediri,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,493405d2-e80a-4f8b-b616-7538dc85cd0b,2025-12-07 20:31:34+00,"{""changes"": []}"

A good practice seen is to use a loud voice like “Hello” “hi!”. This culture seems to have been formed in the class so that some students are able to respond to what the teacher does. This includes checking attendance by singing which involves all students being sensitive to their classmates if someone is absent.
Other positive things at the beginning of the session, such as asking how things are, are good practices that can help students express the emotions and feelings they experienced that morning. Moreover, implementing an emotion board in front of the class is a very effective strategy and attracts students' attention to recognize the various emotions that exist and express them.
Class culture such as raising your hand first before answering is also good and occurs naturally in classroom learning.
There were also several stimulating questions asked by the teacher to help students think and express the results of their thoughts, such as ""Is there something made by humans or from nature?"" from the picture at the start of the session. The use of the Brantas river example is also very contextual for students so that they are able to identify what the teacher is asking for.
The teacher has also been very good at implementing cooperative and collaborative strategies in groups, able to identify students' learning styles and adapt them to students' learning goals and needs. This good practice is very valuable to share with other fellow teachers either via the PMM application or later there will be a digital bulletin of teacher good practices from STIR.
Positive appreciation is also often given by the teacher when there are students/groups who succeed in doing something that is expected.
The teacher is also very good at normalizing mistakes made by students when a group does everything wrong in their project. This culture is very appropriate for the teacher is to implement so that it can encourage positive values and a good sense of self-esteem for students.

- The learning material provided by the teacher seemed somewhat boring to the observer. Although teaching aids were available, they were inadequate due to their possibly small size, especially since this was supposed to be a subject related to IPAS (Integrated Science and Social Studies) covering the topic of Electric Magnets and their relevance to life. 
- The teaching approach also leaned heavily on textbook examples, which missed opportunities to deepen students understanding of why certain material are magnetic. This may impact the students' levels of curiosity and critical thinking.
- The students still followed the lesson without any issues. However, when given an evaluation after the lesson, the average mastery of the material reached 70 percent based on the results obtained by the students.
- The challenges in teaching were also related to the application of learning technology, which was still very limited. 
- The teacher appeared to emphasize rules for the students when answering questions, which might be easily accepted by the students, perhaps because of the small class size, consisting of 2 male students and 5 female students. 
- The teacher could be directed to focus more on learning that could enhance their teaching capacity, providing encouragement and motivation to spark the students' curiosity to delve deeper into the learning material, connecting it more closely with everyday life. This teacher has been teaching for decades and graduated from a teacher training school (SPG) in 1990.
- The teacher presents the learning objectives, and there is an assessment of previous material, but it feels more like a formality without in depth questions, even though these are 5th grade students.
- The principals seem to treat class observations as a formality, spending more time on his phone than observing the classroom process, likely because he is retiring at the end of the month.

This teacher prepares the learning materials well. She is able to conceptualize the learning materials well and bring props and digital models into the classroom. 

This teacher also assesses the student, so she organized the student group based on the coaching strategy, where the smart student are expected to help and bring impact to student who are less.

However, although the concept is good, this teacher seems a bit nervous and unable to maintain the classroom atmosphere to keep the enthusiasm and willingness to learn to the student. 

Often the teacher used good analogies to explain the meaning of the subject matter, but several times the analogies were not understood by the student.

There were no more than five students who answered or asked questions. 

Classroom organization was somewhat lacking as there were several pauses where the students were distracted from doing the other things such as playing and joking with each other.

Exploration to foster student enthusiasm to learn and find out for themselves the meaning of the subject matter is still lacking.

We discussed many things:
1. First, the discussion led to what is the added value during LIC 4 that has been done in Kediri city. We looked back during the implementation and found that the involvement of the Co-Design team in choosing the theme in LIC, ultimately made the theme aligned with the needs of teachers in Kediri city. We also looked back at some of the things that could be improved, for example in the teacher network meeting, they wanted more mentoring from stir staff to all sub-districts/schools. Also in the implementation of ELM, she saw that strict rules need to be enforced so that not many of the supervisory colleagues leave the meeting during the process.

Furthermore, we also discussed a lot about data. I conveyed that the data during the entire LIC 1-4 showed a good trend, where several indicators had increased. On the other hand, Mrs. Sunarsih also still feels that there is still a lot of room for improvements to increase the achievements in the indicators. For example, to improve the critical and curiosity indicators, Mrs. Sunarsih wants the strategy at the next Teachers network meeting to be extended and condensed to all schools, and the material presented is divided into two different time periods in TNM 1 and TNM 2, so that teachers feel more impact from the topics to be studied.

We also discussed the sustainability of the program in Kediri city. She is very aware that STiR will not be with them forever and therefore he wants the Co-Design team to take more of a role in the future. For example as a lead to process data in LIC, discussing every month and others. She is very supportive for the city of Kediri so that in the education sector, they are able to make the right decisions based on needs and make a habit of doing feedback.

Furthermore, we also discussed the next topic to be brought for LIC 5, where he felt that the topic chosen was in accordance with the needs of teachers and only needed to apply strategies to maximize meetings such as ELM, EL institute to TNM to be more effective and well channeled to fellow teachers.

1. Reflection on DC Bootcamp LIC 5 and ELM Institute LIC 4 activities;
2. Approach strategy for ELM Institute;
3. Deck Preparation and finalization for ELM Institute.

The group coaching call was opened by discussing the reflection of the coachee related to the previous DC Bootcamp activities; and also related to the ELM Institute at LIC 4. Participants gave their views regarding what needed to be improved, including the focus that should be increased by delivering interactive material and conducting simulations before ELM activities. 

Coachees also provided and shared data related to how the achievements at LIC 4 for the ELM institute. In this case, participants expressed their opinions based on the data, how then the strategy of the material delivery approach for the ELM institute can be done. The agreed strategies included an interactive approach and utilizing technology such as Kahoot!
In addition, the coachees also agreed that the interactive approach can be adapted to the Game-based learning material; that is, by incorporating the material into the game. 

The two main things that were agreed to be applied in the approach were to develop a cell and also to conduct simulations before the ELM Institute was conducted. The simulation can be done offline with the GPA team. Within this week, DL and IPK Team will finalize the decks for the ELM institute.

questions that arise in GC include:
1. How to connect data-driven decision making with game-based learning?
2. How to deliver interactive and effective material?
3. How to include an element of innovation in the training that will be carried out?",stir_dl,fa5478c7-d04e-46c7-8837-0641680d1498,2025-12-07 20:31:35+00,"{""changes"": []}"

The main problem is not having a standard invitation system, which is better known as the duty of the Education Office (Dinas Pendidikan). There was no reply since the schedule for the District Coordinator Meeting (DCM) had been communicated earlier on, and early coordination was needed, particularly in budgeting. As the revised budget plan won't contain more financial resources, talks about the program need to occur early in the fiscal year.
The DC understands the purpose of supplementary materials for KKPS/ELM meetings and continues to support the Follow Up Action Plan (RTL). More work is required of material planning to have the sessions planned properly. It also needs to engage with the Education Office to develop better participation from the school supervisors. A clear role distribution and collaboration between the community and all the stakeholders is thus needed in order to ensure not only the sustainability of the program.
From a teaching implementation perspective, many are not prepared to teach before actually teaching. Ensure a safe and structured learning environment is in place before planned activities. Adapt lesson material to students' interests, talents, and abilities, and move toward student-centered learning. Classrooms should promote respect for others and cooperation, but instructional clarity is difficult for many teachers who need support. To judge how effective various approaches really are in practice, we recommend a structured approach—focusing on one teaching method at a time, then engaging in reflection.
Going forward, better coordination between STiR and the Education Office is critical to get funds and institutional support. Increasing learning outcomes by integrating case studies and reflective teaching practices into training teachers.

The theme of LIC-5 in Kediri this time is Psychological Support for Active and Meaningful Learning. 
The session was very open and active from all participants. Each participant shared their experiences in contextualizing the materials and techniques discussed throughout the session. 
Participants identified that all materials are very possible to be practiced in their work. In the facilitation technique material, they can practice it in a meeting session with the principal or teacher; in the whole-class feedback session, they can practice it when going to have a session with the principal, for example; then for the restitution triangle material, they can use it when there is a problem from either the principal or teacher's work related to their position.

Safety:
In all sessions conducted, participants were very capable of reflecting on the material with real-world examples that they experienced. They also consciously accepted feedback from the facilitator, both during discussions and practicing independently. In addition, all participants also practiced the strategies they had understood in giving opinions and sharing experiences.

Engagements:
All participants without exception were very actively involved in the discussion sessions held throughout the bootcamp. Participants also always make action plans both collectively and individually to follow up on the material they get throughout the bootcamp session.

C&CT
During the discussion sessions, almost all participants took turns asking questions related to the material in the sessions. Some questions could even be categorized as critical, inviting further discussion with other participants. Even so, critical questions did not come from all participants, at least half of them asked critical questions in the existing sessions. At the same time, all participants agreed that all the materials were very important to support their future work as well as good material to be practiced in their responsibility of

Self esteem:
All participants collaborated throughout the session with peers, both to share experiences and to share problems they faced. At the same time, they also shared strategies on how they solved the problems based on their own experiences. 

Half of the participants also did not hesitate to ask the facilitator for help if there was something they did not understand, both when the material was presented and during the discussion and exercise sessions.

The first is related to the reflection of the DC bootcamp activities that have been carried out. 
Bu Nur reflected that the good practice during the activity was how the enthusiasm of the participants was so great (especially from the IPK team) with their attendance and seriousness in participating in the activity.

Bu Nur also saw that in the essence of the material, all participants fully understood and achieved the objectives of each material. She saw how it was reflected by the participants through discussions and case study activities.

As for the reflection related to the follow-up, Bu Nur conveyed several concerns such as:

- how to convey data-based decision making so that it can be deeply and meaningfully accepted by school supervisors and principals;
- Ibu Nur also reflected that later in the development of the case study, it can use the learning quality points in Lumajang (D1) and is intended for supervisors and principals to analyze the root of the problem and what to do.

The second is related to the timeline of ELM activities:
There is a constraint from the education office budget whose disbursement still has to wait for the inauguration of the new district head. So there is a possibility that activities will be carried out after there is a bright spot related to this. 

Third, responding to the constraints in the second discussion, Bu Nur said:
That despite these obstacles, we must continue by developing selandia or materials for ELM, EL and TNM. The development of the selandia and deck materials will be done collectively by the IPK team in charge along with the DL during February;

In addition, we can also make follow-up sessions related to the observed behavior change data, so that the IPK team has a deep understanding and on a regular basis, they can see what needs to be improved in the future.",60,Sandy,NULL,pasirian,NULL,NULL,lumajang,Nur zaenab ,NULL,NULL,NULL,stir_dl,303cdb03-d6b0-4f36-a25e-0fd222ac6dfc,2025-12-07 20:31:35+00,"{""changes"": []}"

The initial objective was to recognize and analyze the problems faced by DCs, especially those regarding their facilitation function at the school leadership level. A recurring issue that keeps coming up in the conversations is the limitations of the DC's mandated roles and responsibilities, specifically for school principals, especially in LIC-1 areas.
Since school principals are not actively involved in LIC-1, it was proposed to conduct a refresher activity for the KKG Cluster Chairpersons on LIC-1. They are teachers who have experience in guiding their respective KKGs (Teacher Working Groups). This was done in close coordination with the Education Office about the school principals' roles and responsibilities. Under this revised approach, school principals will be responsible for ensuring teacher trainings are put into practice. To preserve this knowledge sharing and training, KKG Cluster Chairpersons will spearhead the teacher training.
To say that the coachees are enthusiastic about the program would be an understatement, and they have wasted no time telling the Education Office that they are eager to dive in to the initiative as soon as formal assignments are doled out. They want to help implement this program, and their willingness to partner shows how well they tell our story. The DCs have stepped into action plans proactively, marked for the teacher training session on February 26th, 2025. The function of this office, combined with regular coordination with the school principals in the sub-districts, is a very useful instrument with optimal support for the staff in the field.In response to the feedback and the evolving needs, DCs have taken proactive measures to actively involve themselves in the follow-up activities.

Prior to the activity, the coachee provided the material so that when the coaching session was conducted, the coaches already had an idea of what to discuss and prepared if there were questions and others. 

The session was very active, where all coachees gave their opinions about the discussion and which sides needed to be improved. Some coachees also adjusted their views to the practice in the field. For example, in the handbook on data decision-making, they saw that this material has often been provided by education offices at the district, provincial and national levels. So then they try to contextualize how the handbook in the material does not have a big difference with the material that has been given; on the one hand, there is also a question of “how can we bring this material to be interactive and not cause stigma because they have already received it”.

The session also provided some captured questions such as:
“How to make this material easy to digest by the participants and yet at the same time also provide novelty to their capacity?”

“How to relate data-driven decisions to their daily work, so that the context when providing case studies and exercises, participants can fully understand?”

“What is the strategy to bring this material to be related and interactive so that participants benefit from the material?”

They also provided a follow-up strategy to meet and discuss materials to be provided in LIC 5 (ELM, EL and NM) after the handbook is finalized and after the DC Bootcamp.",stir_dl,43507dfc-7d04-4dff-a998-c90d0b7e7a2f,2025-12-07 20:31:35+00,"{""changes"": []}"

Throughout the activity, the discussion took place well and really involved the participants. All participants shared various practices and experiences of how they understood the material and the real conditions they were doing.

All participants also practiced and used the strategies provided during the session by exposing them to the real conditions that existed

Some participants during the session also improved how the material received can be contextualized with real conditions in the field, both in terms of challenges and obstacles. They also identified how the material could be best presented in the ELM Institute, EL and Network meetings.

Throughout the session, some participants did not hesitate to ask for help from the facilitator if there were things they did not understand. All participants did not even hesitate to ask their peers next to them about concepts and more.

Some participants asked questions during the session. In addition, some participants even reflected deeply on the existing material and contextualized it with field conditions or what they experienced. Several times the reflection triggered by other participants made all participants reflect critically related to learning strategies and others that they have been doing.

Throughout the session, all participants did not fail to give recognition and appreciation for what other colleagues had done, both for the program and during the activity session.

Furthermore, coachees and coaches discussed intensely how to develop decks that can contain the main elements so that decks can be made interactive and have elements of innovation. all agreed that mainly more sessions should be delivered in the form of games; sharing sessions between participants and simulations. 

Coachees throughout the session also demonstrated their ability to identify challenges and how to solve them. For example, related to the challenge of short time.

1. Reflection on DC Bootcamp LIC 5 and ELM Institute LIC 4 activities;
2. Approach strategy for ELM Institute;
3. Deck Preparation and finalization for ELM Institute.

The group coaching call was opened by discussing the reflection of the coachee related to the previous DC Bootcamp activities; and also related to the ELM Institute at LIC 4. Participants gave their views regarding what needed to be improved, including the focus that should be increased by delivering interactive material and conducting simulations before ELM activities. 

Coachees also provided and shared data related to how the achievements at LIC 4 for the ELM institute. In this case, participants expressed their opinions based on the data, how then the strategy of the material delivery approach for the ELM institute can be done. The agreed strategies included an interactive approach and utilizing technology such as Kahoot!
In addition, the coachees also agreed that the interactive approach can be adapted to the Game-based learning material; that is, by incorporating the material into the game. 

The two main things that were agreed to be applied in the approach were to develop a cell and also to conduct simulations before the ELM Institute was conducted. The simulation can be done offline with the IPK team. Within this week, DL and IPK Team will finalize the decks for the ELM institute.

Questions that arise in GC include:
1. How to connect data-driven decision making with game-based learning?
2. How to deliver interactive and effective material?
3. How to include an element of innovation in the training that will be carried out?",stir_dl,8d491202-60af-4c7e-9f08-1552f814cf56,2025-12-07 20:31:36+00,"{""changes"": []}"

Many supervisors are themselves retiring, and the hiring of supervisors is centrally coordinated, resulting in possible delays and a question mark over the quality of their supervisors.
This phase of transition does not only underline how essential it is to plan succession properly, but it also pinpoints the crucial role of DCs in promoting open communication and coordination. Right now DCs are working hard to keep outgoing supervisors and potential new hires focused on current opportunities and are working to ensure the role modelling will take effect at the school principals' level.
But the undertaking is not without its difficulties. Some managers may not want to be involved, so DCs may have to lead communication. Second, the indirect powers of the DCs to influence appointments are likely to restrict their ability to shape the supervisory side to match the requirements of the district.
Thinking about it in terms of problem solving, we actually see that Malaka’s situation is ripe for adaptive coping (i.e., for investigating new ways to handle the succession planning situation), for bolstering the use of mentoring as a leadership development means, and for focusing more on a structural form of leadership communication that promotes involvement and transparency among leaders at all levels.",30,Marlon Jacob,NULL,combined,NULL,NULL,malaka,Matias Tonas,NULL,NULL,NULL,stir_dl,7f4739de-6c8c-4261-9c45-5889c290ebc7,2025-12-07 20:31:36+00,"{""changes"": []}"

The event began with an opening from the Lumajang District Education Office, followed by a message and reinforcement from Bu Nur, as a DC for Lumajang

Bu Nur emphasized to the elementary school supervisors the importance of implementing data-driven decision-making in Lumajang. She also conveyed that the post-event dissemination should contribute to building the capacity of fellow teachers in the field. Furthermore, she reminded the participants that the material presented on the first day was based on the aspirations of local education stakeholders in Lumajang and aligned with the deep learning focus currently being promoted by the Ministry of Primary Education of the Republic of Indonesia.

The seating arrangement was organized by sub-districts, allowing school supervisors to sit with sub-district facilitators in groups, enabling them to develop relevant follow-up plans by the end of the session. Ms. Susiami delivered the material in an interactive and engaging manner. She often used facilitation techniques that prioritized audience engagement to maintain focus throughout the session. Her presentation involved the participants through several activities, such as matching materials during consolidation sessions, and she consistently acknowledged participants—whether they answered questions or asked them. Opportunities for questions were prioritized during each transition between presentation slides.

At the end of the session, a team-based activity was conducted to analyze the reasons behind the decline in Lumajang's education report in several areas in 2024. Supervisors and facilitators took turns sharing their group perspectives, which were then responded to by other groups.

One key issue identified was the limited dissemination of program content, which did not reach all schools and sub-districts equally. To address this, District Champions agreed that LIC-2 needs a stronger focus on content dissemination and a clearer division of tasks among District Champions, school supervisors, and principals. By assigning specific roles, such as leading dissemination during Teacher Network Meetings (TNMs), supporting selected schools, and coordinating with the District Education Office, they believe the program can reach more schools effectively and avoid overlapping responsibilities. The district champions expressed their commitment to contribute more actively but also raised concerns about their already full workloads and the risk of schedule conflicts with their regular duties. Moving forward, it is essential to develop a clear task-sharing system, improve scheduling, involve additional District Champions to balance the workload, and strengthen the dissemination strategy, especially by using existing TNM. They also recommended continued discussions with the District Education Office to explore additional budget support for field activities. These coaching calls provided valuable, honest insights to help improve LIC-2 implementation with stronger collaboration, better content dissemination, and fairer task management.",30,Marlon Jacob,NULL,combined,NULL,NULL,malaka,Matias Tonas,NULL,NULL,NULL,stir_dl,0a6b9273-c73f-42aa-970e-08951a2d9910,2025-12-07 20:31:36+00,"{""changes"": []}"

However, some noticeable notes were also how throughout the learning session, Bu Pitta was too focused on the material, so that several times the children were busy with their friends or groups. Also, the division of groups tended not to be divided proportionally, causing them to only gather with friends they knew, so that often during group assessments or presentation sessions, they joked around.

Some supervisors shared successful practices from LIC-1, while others honestly expressed challenges they faced, such as limited support or unclear coordination, which affected their ability to fully participate in the previous phase. Supervisors raised several important questions during the meeting, mainly about the implementation process for LIC-2, budget availability, and activity scheduling. These questions were directly addressed by the District Education Office, which confirmed its commitment to supporting school supervisors in field activities, although budget support remains limited and will be considered further in future planning. At the school level, especially for TNM (Teacher Network Meetings), a funding mechanism is already in place through existing school budgets. Supervisors also showed their readiness to be actively involved in facilitating LIC-2 content across their institutes. One of the main lessons from LIC-1 is the limited dissemination of content, which only reached some sub-districts and schools. This will be a priority improvement point moving forward.

On the one hand, as for things that must be considered in the future, it is better for the locus of the implementation location to be handed over to the sub-districts that are members of the activity location locus. This is so that we can provide opportunities for input from participants who want the location to be in another sub-district. In addition, it would be great if the implementation date is not determined by one day only and from the agency. It would be better for the agency to give an appeal for the range of implementation dates only, the rest let fellow sub-districts choose themselves according to the time they have.

As for the implementation of the KKG, the co-design team from the start gave flexibility to cluster colleagues in the sub-district to be carried out according to their preferred dates.

With a different format than before, TNM per cluster was generally very successful and well received by teachers, principals and supervisors. Providing flexibility for the dates of TNM implementation set by each cluster also allowed the activities to be adapted to the time availability of each cluster.

The facilitators who provided the materials were also generally able to combine and improve the materials with the needs of each cluster. The combination of material and role play, as well as the initiative in making participants active are the main values seen in this TNM.

The obstacles seen in the reflection include that not all clusters in the sub-district entered the date of TNM implementation in their area in the form. Therefore, the implementation of TNM could not be monitored by the IPK team.

All four participants joined the sessions with high enthusiasm. They stayed focused, responded to questions, and completed each activity with commitment. It was clear they were eager to learn and take the most from the training. Although the participants were not yet used to asking questions on their own, the facilitators supported them by using thoughtful prompts to check their understanding and spark deeper reflection. This helped ensure that all participants could fully grasp the two main topics, coaching and learning strategies.
Each scenario and exercise was completed well, and the participants showed clear involvement throughout. During partner work, they adjusted their understanding based on discussion and shared their past experiences, including some good practices they had applied in real school contexts. This kind of peer learning helped build confidence and practical insight.
Some of the improvements are the use of sensitive language and the content development. On one occasion the facilitator called Bapak/Ibu, meanwhile there was no Ibu during the meeting that took place. Then again for the content development, we should add the questions to clarify the relevancy of the materials for their professional works.
Another highlight of the bootcamp was the presence of key leadership figures: the head of the district education office, the secretary, and the head of GTK. Their attendance gave a strong positive impression and motivation to the participants. It made the supervisors feel heard, supported, and valued.

As a result, several questions were adjusted using prompting with options to support the conversation.
The coachee showed emerging ability to connect planned actions with a broader objective. For example, the coachee reflected on the importance of aligning the training format and timing with participant readiness to ensure that the content is well received and impactful. This suggests a growing awareness of how implementation choices affect the overall success of the program.
The coachee identified key challenges such as funding and competing priorities for school staff.

The session emphasized the important role of educators not just as instructors but also as moral supporters for school principals and teachers. It was clearly highlighted that when principals and teachers feel heard and accepted, it motivates them and builds trust in the coaching process. This human-centered aspect of coaching is essential for sustainable school improvement. The material presented was strengthened through simple exercises and peer sharing. Participants shared real experiences and discussed both challenges and solutions together. This helped deepen their understanding and fostered a sense of solidarity. The use of reflection and feedback encouraged participants to identify what they already understood while also helping them see what changes could be made to enhance collaborative learning in their schools.

The materials delivered included coaching techniques using the EKSPRESI method, as well as learning strategies with the Think-Pair-Share (TPS) approach. All participants practiced coaching simulations with their peers. In their follow-up action plans, participants also committed to facilitating these materials later in the ELs forum and ensuring that the dissemination of the content continues down to the TNM level.
One important point to note was that the session on coaching, which was initially facilitated by the school supervisor, could not be completed because the supervisor had to attend a meeting with the Head of the District Education Office. The unfinished session was therefore continued and completed by the STiR staff. During the discussion, participants also raised concerns about the potential workload for school principals and teachers due to the implementation of programs from INOVASI, which target all schools in TTU. They acknowledged that this may require additional adjustments in scheduling for TNM activities. Nevertheless, they expressed that the content from STiR/YBPU has so far been well aligned, and they are ready to apply it in practice.

Many shared that although they often accompany teachers in their daily work, their approach had tended to feel more like giving instructions or even criticism. Through this training, they realised the importance of changing the way they conduct conversations with teachers so that coaching becomes supportive and empowering rather than judgemental. The practice focused on key coaching steps: asking powerful and purposeful questions, identifying challenges, creating actionable plans, and establishing follow-up responsibilities. Principals learnt to position themselves as thinking partners with teachers, recognising that effective coaching could directly benefit students’ learning outcomes when teachers felt supported and valued. An interesting aspect of the session was the use of digital tools, such as Quizizz, to prepare questions related to the material. This made the session more interactive and engaging, especially since most participants rarely use digital applications in their daily teaching. For school principals and teachers in this rural area, where access to technology and the district capital requires long travel, this was a valuable opportunity to explore new methods and reflect on their current practices. By the end of the training, principals expressed their commitment to apply what they had learnt in their own schools. They highlighted the need to shift from one-way conversations to more open and reflective dialogues with teachers. They also emphasised the importance of supporting teachers in implementing collaborative learning strategies such as Think-Pair-Share (TPS), which had already been introduced in the session. Overall, the EL Institute in Biboki Anleu provided not only new knowledge but also meaningful reflection for principals. Despite the many challenges in their subdistrict, the participants showed strong motivation to continue improving leadership practices, support teacher growth, and ultimately strengthen student learning outcomes.

The response was very positive, as many school principals admitted they had not expected to receive training that so closely addressed their current needs—namely, how to accompany and support teachers while ensuring that their performance remains aligned with the professional standards required of a school leader. Several principals reflected that their leadership style had often been quite authoritarian in the past, but through this training they became more aware of the importance of shifting toward the TIRTA coaching method introduced by STiR Education. This approach encourages a more collaborative and reflective practice, and participants expressed their readiness to gradually adopt it.

In addition to coaching, the facilitators also introduced an overview of collaborative learning strategies that principals are expected to support and ensure teachers implement in their classrooms. Since schools in this subdistrict are not located very far from the district capital, school principals already have an established monthly meeting routine. They agreed that coaching should become a regular agenda item in these forums so that it gradually builds into a habit that strengthens capacity and supports their role in guiding teachers. This continuity is expected to make professional dialogue more open and sustainable, while also preparing principals to better lead improvements in teaching and learning at their schools.",(web),2171,13,globalsubs@stireducation.org,regular_model,2025-08-12T16:14:40.532Z,indonesia_stir_bm_2022,uuid:e5c35c00-cb96-4c4c-a097-4f26ddbc5493,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/139.0.0.0 Safari/537.36|SurveyCTO web forms 2.81.6",10,NULL,NULL,NULL,3,teachers,NULL,2025-08-18T16:01:46.691Z,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2502110024,sp_indo,male,NULL,elm,NULL,lic_2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,bikomi_selatan,female,NULL,ttu,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,673eea3d-6e62-4943-9b4f-7c7d92f286af,2025-12-07 20:31:36+00,"{""changes"": []}"

In addition, the facilitator also succeeded in making participants openly active in discussing and exchanging ideas in the sessions they led. In the PJBL idea bazaar session, for example, the facilitators constantly circulated and observed how participants exchanged ideas and asked questions related to obstacles and problems in both PM and PJBL.

She used a wide variety of methods and learning sequences, starting from prayer, taking attendance, singing a national song, icebreaking, group work, singing a song related to the topic, and ending with collaborative creation activities.

The lesson focused on food chains. The class was divided into six groups, each working on a different task related to the food chain. Some groups created songs, others made dioramas, completed worksheets, or crafted puppets/decorative displays representing food chains.

The class atmosphere became very lively and engaging, although some students appeared nervous because they were being observed by unfamiliar adults (the supervisor and a staff member from STIR).",cigedug,NULL,NULL,garut,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,34a600e3-1753-45dc-94ca-59e3af1803a4,2025-12-07 20:31:37+00,"{""changes"": []}"

The topic taught was energy. Although the primary method he used was lecturing, he also included several supporting activities such as showing videos, conducting simulations or demonstrations, group work, and using Quizzes for the reflection activity.

He managed the two-hour lesson effectively and on time. One of the most notable aspects was the way he showed warmth and affection toward his students, making them feel appreciated and cared for. He encouraged them, gave praise, addressed them gently as “sayang,” and interacted with them in a very friendly manner.
